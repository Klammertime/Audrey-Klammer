						<h2>Audrey Klammer</h2>
						<h5>Web Developer &amp; Marketer</h5>

						<p>My current obsession is with learning all I can about JavaScript, UX design and creating fun jQuery plugins. I have a Bachelor of Arts in Communication from UC Santa Barbara, a 1-year Multimedia Certificate from Front Range Community College and recently graduated from a 12-week Web Development Bootcamp, WebLab.</p>

						<p>Over the past nine years, I've worked for a collection of forward-thinking companies ranging from an artificial intelligence startup recently acquired by IBM Watson to a newspaper edited by media pundit Dan Savage. During that time, I've been able to hone my skills in web design, digital marketing and communications.</p>

						<p>I created this site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Sublime, and Google Fonts. It takes advantage of responsive web design techniques including responsive typography.</p>

<h3>Testimonials</h3>
<blockquote>

<p>I had the opportunity to work closely with Audrey on a project at AlchemyAPI where she was the UX/frontend developer. In spite of this being a new role for her, she took it upon herself to get educated on the cutting edge UX design and usability techniques. She was able to successfully integrate this knowledge into our project and transformed it from an “engineer-ish” looking website to a polished presentation ready website. </p>

With her combined experience of marketing and UX development, I highly recommend Audrey and believe she can contribute positively to any team.

<p>In the year and a half that I have been at AlchemyAPI, Audrey has been the bridge between engineering and marketing. Rather than latching onto buzz words, she worked with the engineers to really understand the technology and make informed statements. As a result, AlchemyAPI's technology was featured or mentioned in publications including GigaOM, Wired, and MIT Technology Review. </p>

In addition to her desire to understand the core technologies at AlchemyAPI, Audrey also has a drive to learn about and use technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML in your job as a marketer. As such, I feel that Audrey is the embodiment of the technical marketer.

<blockquote>
<p>Audrey notices things that other people don't. She is an extremely perceptive person. </p>

<p>I enjoyed collaborating with Audrey over a span of two years on a variety of interviews and marketing content. She's an excellent communicator. Whenever we had a conversation I always knew we were going to end up on the same page. Her attention to detail served her well as she successfully transitioned into a UX-focused role. But her social awareness is what allowed her to build true connections and be integral to the culture at Alchemy. </p>

I recommend Audrey without reservation for any position emphasizing user experience, technical marketing, or the interfaces between computers and people.

<blockquote>
<p>Audrey has knockout talent when it comes to understanding human experience, whether it's drawing people into a marketing funnel, designing the interactions of our next big web application, or spewing interestingly amusing facts about human interactions over a cup of coffee. </p>

<p>I worked with her for nearly two years, and as a hard working Jill-of-all-trades, she was an endlessly invaluable resource to her employees, peers, and all of the company. Her quirky quips, kind heart, and attentive personality mimicked her distinguished style, and glued us into a cohesive force that I haven't experienced anywhere else. </p>

Audrey has got a style all her own, and I am proud to know her. I hope that I will have the opportunity to work with her again in the future.

I had the pleasure to work with Audrey while she designed the website and logo for my online business, Mod Clay.

I worked with Audrey at AlchemyAPI. She always had insightful and well reasoned guidance for our UX problems. I could always trust that she was pointing us in the right direction.

<div class="testimonial">
<blockquote>
<p>Having worked with Audrey for over a year at AlchemyAPI, I can confidently say that she is a competent, versatile, and passionate technical marketing director. At a company like ours, with over 75% of the employees being engineers, "fitting in" as a marketing expert is incredibly challenging. Nonetheless, Audrey has always been skilled at communicating with researchers and programmers, teasing out from off-the-cuff conversations the true gravity and details of specific projects being pursued here. </p>

<p>She is entertaining, engaging, and truly excited about the future of artificial intelligence along with what it means for society. She actively shows this with her enthusiasm for working with engineers to fully harness the power of our press releases and with her knack for organizing local meetups to help promote our company.</p>

Audrey brings a technical lens to the table, along with her skills as a marketer. She is remarkably easy to work with, and I recommend her without any hesitation.
